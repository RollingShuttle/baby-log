launch.py — start the app and open it in its own window.

`python app.py` leaves you with a console and an address to type. This does the same job but
behaves like a desktop program: it starts the server, waits until it is actually answering, and
opens it in a browser window with no address bar, no tabs and no bookmarks — just the app.

Closing that window does **not** stop it. The app keeps running in the notification area, so the
next window opens instantly and anything the phone uploads still lands while you are not looking
at it. Quit from the tray icon when you actually want it to stop.

Four details worth knowing:

  * The server runs in a thread of *this* process rather than a separate one, so it cannot outlive
    the launcher and leave a port held by an invisible program.
  * The tray icon is not decoration. Once the window is no longer the way out, it is the only way
    to stop the app short of Task Manager — so if a tray cannot be created, the app deliberately
    goes back to closing with its window rather than becoming unstoppable.
  * The browser process cannot be waited on. Edge hands off to a background process and the one
    we started exits within a moment, even with its own profile — waiting on it shut the server
    down while the window was still on screen, showing a dead page. So the *page* tells us when
    it is going, and we keep running until it does.
  * There is only ever one of it, and that takes two separate guards. A named mutex keeps the
    *process* unique — the port probe cannot, because the gap between looking and binding is one
    double-click wide. Keeping the *window* unique is the harder half: a second copy cannot judge
    it, since Edge takes seconds to draw a window and during that gap there is nothing to find.
    So a second launch never opens one. It asks the owner over HTTP and leaves, and the owner
    answers from what it remembers asking for rather than from what it can see.

    python launch.py                 start it and open the window
    python launch.py --no-window     start it and print the address (the old behaviour)
    python launch.py --no-tray       stop when the window closes, instead of staying resident
