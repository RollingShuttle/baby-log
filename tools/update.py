"""
update.py — bring this machine up to date.

    python tools/update.py    (or double-click update.bat)

Fetches the latest code, reinstalls the libraries if they changed, and rebuilds the app. Meant to
be the only thing you run: doing it by hand means remembering to quit the app first, and forgetting
that is silent — the rebuild fails or is skipped and you carry on using yesterday's copy with
nothing on screen to say so.

Four things it is careful about:

  * The running app holds its own .exe open, so the build cannot replace it. That is stopped first,
    and only after the pull has actually brought something new.
  * config.yaml, data/ and Baby Log.xlsx are yours and are not in the repository, so a pull cannot
    touch them. If you have edited any tracked file yourself, the pull is refused rather than
    forced, and it says which file.
  * The libraries are only reinstalled when requirements.txt actually changed.
  * The rebuild is skipped when nothing came down and the app is already there, because it takes
    twenty seconds and would otherwise run every time for nothing.
